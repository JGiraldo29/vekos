#description
[Vekos](https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos) is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based OS with built-in cryptographic verification, ensuring security, integrity, and [tamper-proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tamper_software) computing.

#extra
  ::list
  - **Verified Operations**: Cryptographic verification for filesystem and memory operations
  - **Secure Memory Management**: Buddy allocator with memory zones and COW support
  - **Modern Shell**: Basic shell with command history and line editing
  - **Verified Filesystem (VKFS)**: Merkle tree-backed filesystem for integrity
  - **Process Management**: Basic process scheduling and signals
  - **Hardware Support**: x86_64 architecture with GDT, IDT, and interrupt
