# Getting Started

Get Vekos up and running on your machine in just a few steps.

## Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Vekos repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos.git
cd vekos
```

## Install Rust Toolchain

Make sure you have the latest Rust toolchain installed. If not, install it using:

::code-group
  ```bash [Windows]
  # Step 1: Go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
  # Select either the 32-bit or 64-bit (depending on your system architecture)

  # Step 2: Open the .exe file and go along with the standard installation

  # Step 3: Verify Rust installation in the terminal with:
  rustc --version

  # Troubleshooting:
  # If Rust is not recognized, add this to your PATH "C:\Users\YourUsername\.cargo\bin"
  ```
  ```bash [macOS]
  # Open the terminal and paste the command below:
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  # (make sure you proceed with default installation)

  # Verify Rust installation with:
  rustc --version
  ```
  ```bash [Linux]
  # Open the terminal and paste the command below:
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  # (make sure you proceed with default installation)

  # Add the Rust toolchain directory to the PATH environment variable:
  source $HOME/.cargo/env

  # Verify Rust installation with:
  rustc --version
  ```
::

Then, add the required Rust components:

```bash
rustup component add rust-src
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

## Build Vekos

To build the kernel, run the following:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Run Vekos

Vekos requires [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [bootimage](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage) to run.

To install QEMU, run the following commands:

::code-group
  ```bash [Windows]
  # Step 1: Go to https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/
  # Download the topmost .exe file (usually after the folders)

  # Step 2: Open the .exe file and go along with the standard installation

  # Step 3: Go to https://www.msys2.org/ and click on the .exe file

  # Step 4: Go through the default installation and click Finish at the end to open the terminal

  # Type the following command so you can compile and manage the project:
  pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
  pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qemu

  ```
  ```bash [macOS]
  # For Homebrew:
  brew install qemu
  
  # For MacPorts:
  sudo port install qemu
  ```
  ```bash [Linux]
  # Arch:
  pacman -S qemu

  # Debian/Ubuntu:
  apt-get install qemu-system

  # Fedora:
  dnf install @virtualization

  # Gentoo:
  emerge --ask app-emulation/qemu

  # RHEL/CentOS:
  yum install qemu-kvm

  # SUSE:
  zypper install qemu
  ```
::

To install bootimage, run the following command:
```bash
cargo install bootimage
```

Then, you can run Vekos with:

```bash
cargo run
```
